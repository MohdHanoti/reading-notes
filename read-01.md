## Awesome Python Environment
The Python interpreter is a virtual machine, meaning that it is software that emulates a physical computer. This particular virtual machine is a stack machine: it manipulates several stacks to perform its operations (as contrasted with a register machine, which writes to and reads from particular memory locations).

Dependency Management,
Managing project dependencies in python can become messy or manual. There exists a bunch of tools to help you with that.

Apart from many other things, poetry helps you to easily

manage your projectsâ€™ dependencies,

separate your projects through virtual environments,

build both applications as well as libraries without headaches.
