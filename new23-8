What is the spread operator?




a new addition to the set of operators in JavaScript ES6. It takes in an iterable (e.g an array) and expands it into individual elements. The spread operator is commonly used to make shallow copies of JS objects. Using this operator makes the code concise and enhances its readability

List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

function combineArray(array1, array2) {
  return [...array1, ...array2];
}

const isArray = [1, 2, 3];
const notArray = 'random';

combineArray(isArray, notArray);
// 😱 [ 1, 2, 3, 'r', 'a', 'n', 'd', 'o', 'm' ]
Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
	const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
	console.log(fewMoreFruit) // Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]
Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.
	const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
	const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
	const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
	console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
	const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
	objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂
