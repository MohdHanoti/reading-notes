Who is Roy Fielding?
Some guy. He's smart. He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? they weren’t designed to be used like that they weren't designed to achieve this goal
What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
That first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.

What does a GETdo?
requesting information from a particular source. It is also used to get a specific variable derived from a group. The HTTP POST asks for input of information from the supplying browser into the server's message system

What does a POSTdo?
The post is the public service or system by which letters and packages are collected and delivered.

What does PUTdo?
PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

What does PATCHdo?
It is similar to the PUT but it applies partial modifications.
