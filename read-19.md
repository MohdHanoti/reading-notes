## Introduction to Django

Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.

### Templates

Django’s template language is designed to strike a balance between power and ease. It’s designed to feel comfortable and easy-to-learn to those used to working with HTML, like designers and front-end developers. But it is also flexible and highly extensible, allowing developers to augment the template language as needed.

### Forms

Django provides a powerful form library that handles rendering forms as HTML, validating user-submitted data, and converting that data to native Python types. Django also provides a way to generate forms from your existing models and use those forms to create and update data.

### Authentication

Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. This lets you easily build sites that allow users to create accounts and safely log in/out.

### Admin

One of the most powerful parts of Django is its automatic admin interface. It reads metadata in your models to provide a powerful and production-ready interface that content producers can immediately use to start managing content on your site. It’s easy to set up and provides many hooks for customization.

### Internationalization

Django offers full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers, and time zones. It lets developers and template authors specify which parts of their apps should be translated or formatted for local languages and cultures, and it uses these hooks to localize web applications for particular users according to their preferences.

## How Django Works Behind the Scenes

As with all open source projects, the two major issues that crop up are funding and control. Let’s start with funding: why does an open-source project need funding?

It turns out that while writing code is fun and developers are generally willing to contribute their time for free to do so, there are a host of decidedly less fun tasks needed to maintain and sustain an open source project. This includes handling any legal/trademark issues, triaging tickets, guiding community discussions, organizing conferences, managing releases, and so on. As a result, almost all popular open source packages have some degree of funding involved, typically in one of three forms:

1) Corporate Sponsor - A group of engineers within a larger, for-profit company decide to open-source internal code. This is how React (Facebook) and Angular (Google) emerged. Typically engineers at the company are paid, in part, to work on open source though community involvement from developers outside of the core company occurs as well. While this structure has the stability of a wealthy benefactor, there can be confusion around the licensing aspects at times.

2) Solo - An individual developer initially creates code, open sources it, and retains default control. This is the case for VueJS, Tailwind CSS, and Laravel, among others. Typically the lead developer either raises contributions directly like Evan You of VueJS, offer add-on services like Spark for Laravel, or the founders provide highly-paid consulting services.

3) Non-profit - This was Django’s approach early on, in 2008, when the Django Software Foundation was formed to promote, support, and advance Django.

So where does this Django behind the scenes tour leave us? Django’s code is open source and available to all. Django’s organization is managed by a non-profit, the DSF, with a miniscule budget. And Django code is lead by a core team of volunteers, two paid Django Fellows, and a larger group of contributors.

One of the best ways to become more involved in Django is to attend an annual conference and meet all the contributors in person. Currently there are DjangoCons in the US, Europe, Australia, and Africa in 2020 for the first time. I hope to see some of you there!
