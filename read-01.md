## Big O notation 
Big O notation is one of the most fundamental tools for computer scientists to analyze the cost of an algorithm. It is a good practice for software engineers to understand in-depth as well. Big O notation describes the complexity of your code using algebraic terms.

## Awesome Python Environment
The Python interpreter is a virtual machine, meaning that it is software that emulates a physical computer. This particular virtual machine is a stack machine: it manipulates several stacks to perform its operations (as contrasted with a register machine, which writes to and reads from particular memory locations).

Dependency Management,
Managing project dependencies in python can become messy or manual. There exists a bunch of tools to help you with that.

Apart from many other things, poetry helps you to easily

manage your projects’ dependencies,

separate your projects through virtual environments,

build both applications as well as libraries without headaches.

## Python 3 Module of the Week
PyMOTW-3 is a series of articles written by Doug Hellmann to demonstrate how to use the modules of the Python 3 standard library. It is based on the original PyMOTW series, which covered Python 2.7. See About Python Module of the Week for details including the version of Python and tools used.
